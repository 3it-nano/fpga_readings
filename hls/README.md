# HLS Sample Code

Sample Xilinx HLS code.

## Coding Style

I follow normal Linux kernel coding style. Tab is hard, and equals 8 spaces. Comment use `/* .. */`, even if it is just one line. I'm a newbie when it comes to C++, so certian formats about C++ need more coding to form. Anyhow, I'm pretty picky about codings style, I mean, just the format. As for writing good code, always have this rule in mind: write code for other folks, for you who are reading the core after a month.
