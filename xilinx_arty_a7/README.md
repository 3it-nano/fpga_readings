		- we have a 10/100 PHY, clearly, we can only use AXI Ethernet Lite.
		- I certainly need to figure out a way to PRINT, which is essential for human life, I'd say. JTAG serial?
	- 12/06/18: I'm trying to add a MAC and connect it with TI PHY. After that, I will write some logic to loopback any packets it get. Hopefully I could write that in HLS.

	- First time reading a DRAM chip datasheet
	- To use it, we need to have a Memory Controller at FPGA chip (Use Xilinx MIG to generate one)

## MAC Reference Design

I added some MAC reference design source code that is generated by Xilinx.
I was interested in how a logic should interact with a MAC IP (e.g., a tri-mode
MAC). Each MAP IP, has its own interface for TX and RX. That it requires
specific logic to drive each MAC. This is really similar to device drivers.

After some digging, I found where those "specific" part come to play. All
following files are implemented according to their spec:

- Tri-mode MAC
	- `tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_tx_client_fifo.v`
	- `tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_rx_client_fifo.v`

- 10G MAC
	- `ten_gig_eth_mac_0_axi_fifo.v`

Anyhow, the common practice should be

- 1) build a general FIFO layer that is used by all upper layer apps
- 2) Port FIFO for each specific MAC IP
- 3) Who does not love indirection?

	- I like this blog, simple yet explained a lot things.
	- This one uses clock input. We should add a clock wizard to try more.

	-  A great one on DRAM access
