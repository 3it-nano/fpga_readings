# FPGA Random Notes

System community has never been so excited about FPGA. And you can tell FPGA is
the next big thing. I was not a fan of HDL (Hard and Difficult Language), mainly
because there wasn't project interesting enough. But things have changed.
I have envisioned a large FPGA infrastructure platform for datacenter. And I alway
like hardcore coding. So it's time to get started.
This repo is really just a collection of stuff along my way learning FPGA.
Contributions in whatever form are welcomed.
