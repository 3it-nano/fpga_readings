- [What's `Implementation` in Xilinx?](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx11/ise_c_implement_fpga_design.htm)
	- Xilinx Implementation happens after Synthesis, so it must include several important steps: 1) Logic Optimization, 2) Technology Mapping, 3) Place and Route. Afte this, you can generate bitstream and push into FPGAs.

	- By default, all XDC files and Tcl scripts added to a constraint set are used for both synthesis and implementation. Set the `USED_IN_SYNTHESIS` and `USED_IN_IMPLEMENTATION` properties on the XDC file or the Tcl script to change this behavior.

- `How to connect IPs?`
	- I came to this question when I tried to build blocks in HLS and Verilog, and was thinking about how should I connect those blocks? There are so many clk, reset, valid signal combinations, is there a standard for this communication protocol? Indeed, there are. This thread collects information about this topic.

	- AMBAÂ® 4 AXI4-Stream Protocol
		- The AXI4-Stream protocol requires that all transfers remain __ordered__. It does not permit the reordering of transfers.
		- __AXI4-Stream removes the requirement for an address phase altogether and allows unlimited data burst size. AXI4-Stream interfaces and transfers do not have address phases and are therefore not considered to be memory-mapped.__
	- Summary:
		- AXI4 has many channels, each channel has its own TVALID,
		TREADY and more. AXI-Lite is a subset of AXI4. AXI-stream is more
		simpilifed, in the sense that it actually only has one channel, which
		means only one TVALID, TREADY signals. AXI-stream is unidirectional
		between master and slave.
		- Like the tri-mode MAC, it is using AXI-stream for both TX and
		RX path. That means, if I want to build a new IP block to talk
		with MAC, my new IP only needs to conform with AXI-stream
		protocol.
	- Just a side, MII is the interconnect protocol specifically between MAC and PHY.

- HLS
  	- `Data I/O protocols`: those are directives that control how the input/output signals interact with outside users.
    	- ap_hs
    	- ap_vld
		- ap_ack
	- `Block-level I/O protocols`: this allows the RTL design to be controlled by additional ports independently of the data I/O ports.
    	- ap_ctrl_hs
    	- ap_ctrl_none
    	- ap_ctrl_chained
    	- s_axilite
    	- which one should I use?
